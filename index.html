                    <h2>All Against Odds</h2>
                    <p>Trevor’s life journey proves that no matter how hard your start is, you can rise.he faced endless
                        challenges but turned his story into inspiration.
                        Being born mixed-race during apartheid was considered illegal and dangerous. Trevor’s life was
                        filled with poverty, racism, violence and
                        a divided society. Despite all of that,he found strength through his intelligence, humor, and
                        the unconditional love of his mother. The title
                        Against All Odds captures the resilience, determination and courage it took for him to survive
                        and eventually succeed. It honors his story
                        as one of mastery in the face of extreme adversity. </p>

                    <h2>Born a Crime</h2>
                    <p>Born a Crime is a powerful memoir by comedian Trevor Noah, sharing his story of growing up in
                        apartheid
                        and post-apartheid South Africa.
                        Born to a Black mother and a White father,Trevor's existence was literally a crime under South
                        African
                        law.</p>

                <h2>Born a Crime: Personal Reflection</h2>
                <blockquote><em>"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love
                        with
                        subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a
                        cage."</em></blockquote>
                <p id="comment">This quote made me think about how some people admire independence women in idea  but feel insecure by
                    them in practice.
                    This thinking still exist in today’s society.Many women are encouraged to be outspoken and 
                    confident publicly. However, in
                    private relationships,those same charachters can be seen as "too much" or "intimidating" by men who
                    expect more traditional and submissive
                    roles.
                    This contradiction mirrors Abel’s mindset, loving the idea of a free and strong woman, while craving dominance over his wife.
                    Today, while
                    gender roles are changing, the old expectations are still much alive. Men have the perception that women have to be controlled by their husbands.
                    Social media
                    makes this pressure even worse. On platforms like Instagram and TikTok, there’s a lot of talk about
                    "soft life" and "submissive
                    girlfriend" trends, where women are encouraged to be dependent and gentle to attract men.
                    This book make me realize that real love should not feel
                    like losing pieces of yourself
                    to make someone else comfortable. Love should be a space where both partners grow, thrive and support
                    each other’s freedom and
                    choices.Trevor’s story teaches us relationships built on respect are the ones that last, while those
                    built on control and fear only
                    cause pain to both partners. Patricia’s courage reminds us that staying true to yourself is more important than
                    fitting into someone else’s idea of who you should be. It shows how dangerous it is when men want 
                    ownership instead of partnership in marriage.In today’s world, we must continue to challenge old expectations and create relationships where
                    freedom and love go hand in hand, women's voices are heard and their opinion matters.</p>
