                    <h2>All Against Odds</h2>
                    <p>Trevor’s life proves that no matter how hard your start is, you can rise.he faced endless
                        challenges but turned his story into inspiration.
                        It reminds us resilience beats circumstance.It reflects Trevor Noah’s journey of overcoming
                        nearly impossible challenges and obstacles.
                        Being born mixed-race during apartheid was considered illegal and dangerous. Trevor’s life was
                        filled with poverty, racism, violence and
                        a divided society. Despite all of that,he found strength through his intelligence, humor, and
                        the unconditional love of his mother. The title
                        Against All Odds captures the resilience, determination and courage it took for him to survive
                        and eventually succeed. It honors his story
                        as one of mastery in the face of extreme adversity. </p>

                    <h2>Born a Crime</h2>
                    <p>Born a Crime is a powerful memoir by comedian Trevor Noah, sharing his story of growing up in
                        apartheid
                        and post-apartheid South Africa.
                        Born to a Black mother and a White father,Trevor's existence was literally a crime under South
                        African
                        law.</p>

                <h2>Born a Crime: Personal Reflection</h2>
                <blockquote><em>"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love
                        with
                        subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a
                        cage."</em></blockquote>
                <p>This quote made me think about how some people admire independence in theory but feel threatened by
                    itin practice.
                    It is a powerful reminder that true love should never feel like a cage and freedom within love
                    should be protected not taken
                    away.This dynamic still resonates in today’s society.Many women are encouraged to be outspoken,
                    confident publicly. However, in
                    private relationships,those same traits can be seen as "too much" or "intimidating" by partners who
                    expect more traditional, submissive
                    roles. The idea of a “strong woman” is celebrated, but only up to the point where it doesn’t
                    challenge the man's ego or authority.
                    This contradiction mirrors Abel’s mindset, loving the idea of a free woman, while craving dominance,
                    control and submission.Today, while
                    gender roles are changing, the old expectations still linger.Women are judged for not being
                    "traditional enough" at home. Social media
                    makes this pressure even worse. On platforms like Instagram or TikTok, there’s a lot of talk about
                    "soft life" and "submissive
                    girlfriend" trends, where women are encouraged to be dependent and gentle to attract men. It shows
                    that old ideas about control
                    and gender roles are still very much alive.This book make me realize that real love should not feel
                    like losing pieces of yourself
                    to make someone else comfortable. Love should be a space where both people grow, thrive and support
                    each other’s freedom and
                    choices.Trevor’s story teaches us relationships built on respect are the ones that last, while those
                    built on control and fear only
                    cause pain. Patricia’s courage reminds us that staying true to yourself is more important than
                    fitting into someone else’s idea of
                    who you should be. Patricia’s bravery show how dangerous and painful it is when love becomes about
                    ownership instead of partnership.
                    In today’s world, we must continue to challenge old expectations and create relationships where
                    freedom and love go hand in hand.</p>
